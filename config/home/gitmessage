# Commit types (SemVer = Semantic Versioning)
# fix: commit that fixes/patches a bug (PATCH in SemVer)
# feat: a commit that introduces a new feature (MINOR in SemVer)
# BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or
# has a ! after the type/scope (MAJOR in SemVer).
# A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

# types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example
# build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:,
# refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
# footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and
# follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
# Additional types are not mandated and have no implicit effect
# in SemVer unless BREAKING CHANGE is included
# A scope can be added after type in parentheses to provide context
# feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.
