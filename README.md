<h1 align="center">Arch dotfiles</h1>
Welcome to the dotfiles of pearmeow. Everything should work when running the scripts, but currently there is no locking mechanism.

Notes
-----
- Scripts are expected to be run in the scripts directory. Not doing so may result in things breaking.
- misc.sh adds groups to the user "pearmeow", which is hardcoded.
- Some of the paths in awesomewm's config are hardcoded to /home/pearmeow/...
