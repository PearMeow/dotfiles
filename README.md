<h1 align="center">Arch dotfiles</h1>
Welcome to the dotfiles of pearmeow. Everything should work when running the scripts except for misc.sh, in which the user must be specified.

Notes
-----
- Scripts are expected to be run in the scripts directory. Not doing so may result in things breaking.
- misc.sh adds groups to the user "pearmeow", which is hardcoded.
